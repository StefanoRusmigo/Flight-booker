# Flight Tracker
Flight Tracker is a Rails capstone project that is part of The Odin Project's Rails curriculum. The assignment can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/building-advanced-forms). The project is meant to showcase the use of Rails associations and nested forms to build a simple flight booking application.
